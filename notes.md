keep working on progression

more effects as multi increases
heavies should rotate based on their speed + larger particles
should have 3 levels of launch speed, add extra color when going even faster (purple?)
make enemies avoid eachother better (use wandering like in sentient edge)
allow multiple powerups simultaneously
